# RoboSmith

RoboSmith is a Discord bot built for use by the Swival Chair Patrol Discord server.

## Features:
- Full server logging.  
- QOTD (in progress)  
- Voice channel recording to hopefully assist in complying with CAP CPP.
- Might add a pomodoro timer bc why not.

## Usage:
The bot does support being on multiple servers. If you wish to use the bot in your Discord server, contact me in the SCP Discord.

## Contributing
Any pull requests are welcome, provided they meet the following requirements:
- I like the contents of the request (If I don't like a feature or it causes problems, it may not get accepted).
- The code still compiles and runs normally without issue (If I notice performance taking a notable hit or the database ballooning in size, the change will get reverted).
- You'll need to understand the code and be able to explain it and its failure cases. I don't want to have to double-check a bunch of AI slop bc the one who made it does not know what they are doing. 
- It does not make me do extra work (I would recommend staying away from anything that would force me to migrate the database unless I say it's okay).
